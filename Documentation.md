# Why Write Documentation?

* You will be using the code in 6 months
* Others will be using your code
* Properly understanding and communicating your code to others

# Best Practices

* Include a README.md file that contains
* A brief description of the project
* Installation instructions
* A short example/tutorial
* Allow issue tracker for others
* Write out API documentation
* What the functions do
* What are the functions parameters or arguments
* What a function returns
* Document your code and use comments to break down sections
* Apply coding conventions, such as file organization, comments, naming conventions, programming practices, etc.
* Include information for contributors
* Include citation information
* Include licensing information
* Link to appropriate email address at the end
* List all the versions of the files along with major edits you did in each version.
* Naming files should be descriptive and consistent
